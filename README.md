## What does the team name mean?

Merriam-Webster's defines vacuous as "marked by lack of ideas or intelligence". 

We chose this phrase to represent our team mostly as an attempt at humour but also a commentary on our odds of winning this competition as a team of first-year student with relatively little formal expereince in programming compared to older students.
