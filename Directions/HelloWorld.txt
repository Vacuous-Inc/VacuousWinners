Why Learn a Programming Language?
Unfortunately for us, computers don't speak any human language. Instead, they understand binary code, which is a bunch of 1s and 0s. The solution: programming languages. Programming languages are instructions written in a form that we can understand, which are then converted into a structure that the computer can execute.

Hello World!
When learning a new programming language, it is customary to start with a program that writes out "Hello World!" In some languages, even this can be complicated, but Python makes it very easy with the *print()* fuction, which will print whatever we put between the parenthesis.
So, if you want to print "Hello World!" all you need to do is write 
print("Hello World!")

Try it for yourself!
