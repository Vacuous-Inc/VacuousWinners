Final Excersise!
Congrats on making it all this way!

Unfortunately for you, I'm not gonna give you a lot of instructions.

First, prompt the user for a string containing parenthesis. Then have a function, balanced(s), return True if the parenthesis are balanced, and False otherwise. Finally, print "The parenthesis are balanced!" if the parethesis are balanced, and "The parenthesis are not balanced!" otherwise.

Examples of strings with balanced parenthesis:
"(Hello)"
"(What's(up (with (you?))))"

Examples of strings with unbalanced parenthesis:
"("
"(Vacu(ous Winners)"
